        <SectionHeader>About Nicholas Flatoff</SectionHeader>
        <p>
          Nicholas was born a tinkerer. After fixing a broken espresso machine
          found in his parentâ€™s basement when he was 14, he began the endless
          journey towards pulling the perfect shot.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Nicholas flipped espresso machines throughout college, where he
          studied Aircraft Maintenance. After completing his AMT certification,
          Nicholas worked as a barista and cafe manager until he accepted a job
          as a portfolio manager for a real estate group.

        <p>
          During his hiatus from the coffee industry, Nicholas remained
          connected to coffee by serving on the board of a non-profit tasked
          with assisting small businesses during startup and offering small
          business consulting services. Nicholas has assisted cafes, roasteries,
          brewers and other ventures successfully launch, sell, or buy their
          businesses.

        <p>
          Burned out by office work, Nicholas returned to the coffee industry as
          a roaster systems technician in 2018. Since then, Nicholas has
          performed installs and maintenance in more than 20 states and
          internationally across North America, Europe and the Middle East.

        <p>
          Nicholas works closely with Sovda Coffee as an optical sorter
          technician and trainer. He has worked on Loring roasters extensively
          and is competent with both conventional and air roasters, plus
          storage, conveyance and QC systems for both green and roasted coffee.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nicholas holds an FAA Aircraft Maintenance Certification and is a
          certified Q grader.
